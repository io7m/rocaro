 * The type of composite resources.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A <i>composite</i> resource collects a set of <i>primitive</i> resources
 * into a single object. This allows applications to refer to resources in
 * a more convenient and type-safe manner. For example, applications can
 * collect a set of image resources representing the components of a
 * <i>g-buffer</i> into a composite resource, and then refer to the composite
 * resource as a value of a <i>g-buffer</i> resource type, as opposed to
 * carrying around a set of loose image resources. The composite resource
 * itself has no concrete representation on the graphics device.
